A mind mapping tool with intuitive design.

# About
Here, your thoughts, ideas and notes come to life, a space to express these abstract concepts. The purpose of this programming adventure is to create enhance the design and UI / UX of most mind mapping tools available on the market. 
Moreover, Idea Space will bring forward the concept of linking notes with documents but not restricted to the usual top down page view, but a dynamic canvas. This allows the user to freely draw and highlight important relationships, limited only to one's imagination.

Sometimes, you need to store lots of information but the information density of mind maps is lower than that of a page. Thus, both features are added into the system.
